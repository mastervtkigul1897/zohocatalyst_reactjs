Certainly! Let's go through each file and explain their purpose and structure:

MyComponent.tsx:
This file contains the main component MyComponent, which serves as the entry point for rendering the application. It imports the necessary dependencies and other components. The MyComponent component renders the overall structure of the application, including the table, modals, and create data section.

TableComponent.tsx:
This file contains the TableComponent component, which represents the table displaying the data. It imports the necessary dependencies, including React, the CSS file, and the Data interface. The TableComponent component receives data as a prop and maps over it to render rows in the table. It also includes buttons for editing, deleting, and viewing individual data items.

Data.ts:
This file contains the Data interface, which defines the structure of the data object used in the application. It specifies the properties Name, Age, and ROWID with their respective types.

EditModal.tsx:
This file contains the EditModal component, which represents the modal for editing data. It imports the necessary dependencies and the Data interface. The EditModal component receives props such as the selected item, edit values, and functions for handling the modal state and editing data. It renders a modal with input fields for editing the name and age values, along with buttons for saving and closing the modal.

ViewModal.tsx:
This file contains the ViewModal component, which represents the modal for viewing data. It imports the necessary dependencies and the Data interface. The ViewModal component receives props such as the selected item and functions for handling the modal state. It renders a modal with labels displaying the name and age values of the selected item, along with a close button.

CreateModal.tsx:
This file contains the CreateModal component, which represents the modal for creating new data. It imports the necessary dependencies. The CreateModal component receives props such as the create values and functions for handling the modal state and creating data. It renders a modal with input fields for entering the name and age values, along with buttons for creating and closing the modal.

By splitting the code into separate files, it promotes better organization and modularity. Each component focuses on a specific functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. The main component (MyComponent) acts as the composition point, bringing together the table, edit modal, view modal, create modal, and their associated logic.

Certainly! Let's go through the code and explain its functionality step by step:

Imports and Dependencies:

The code begins with importing the necessary dependencies, such as React, CSS files, and components from the React Bootstrap library.
It also imports the Data interface that defines the structure of the data object used in the application.
MyComponent Function Component:

The code defines a function component named MyComponent using the React.FC type.
Inside the component, multiple state variables are declared using the useState hook to manage the application's state.
The state variables include data to store the fetched data, selectedItem to hold the currently selected item, editName and editAge to track the values for editing, createName and createAge to store the values for creating new data, and boolean variables to control the visibility of modals.
The useEffect hook is used to fetch the data from the server when the component mounts.
fetchData Function:

The fetchData function is an asynchronous function that makes a GET request to the server to fetch the data.
It updates the data state variable with the fetched data or logs an error if the request fails.
Event Handlers:

The component defines various event handler functions, including handleViewClick, handleEditClick, handleEditSave, handleDeleteClick, and handleCreateClick.
These event handlers perform actions such as setting the selected item, updating the edit values, making API requests to edit/delete/create data, and managing the state variables to control the modals.
Modal Components:

The component renders three modal components: EditModal, ViewModal, and CreateModal.
The modals are conditionally rendered based on the respective boolean state variables.
The modals receive the necessary props such as selected item, edit values, create values, and event handlers to manage their state and perform actions.
Table Component:

The component renders a table element to display the fetched data.
It maps over the data array using the map function to generate rows for each item in the data.
Each row contains the ID, Name, Age, and action buttons for editing, deleting, and viewing the corresponding item.
Create Data Section:

The component renders a section to create new data.
It includes input fields for entering the name and age values, along with a button to trigger the creation process.
Clicking the "Create" button invokes the handleCreateClick function to initiate the API request for creating data.
Component Rendering:

The component returns JSX elements representing the structure of the application.
It includes the table, modals, and create data section.
The modals are conditionally rendered based on the respective boolean state variables.
The JSX elements are wrapped inside a container div and styled using CSS classes.
Exporting the Component:

The MyComponent function component is exported as the default export of the module.
By splitting the code into separate components, it enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability. Each component has a specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify specific parts of the application. The use of state hooks (useState) allows for managing and updating the application's state, ensuring the UI remains in sync with the data and user interactions.
